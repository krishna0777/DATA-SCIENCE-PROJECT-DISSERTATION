ABSTRACT

Depression is a common mental disorder. The illness is estimated to afflict 5 percent of adults worldwide. It is characterized by persistent sadness and a loss of interest in formerly rewarding or enjoyable activities. Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world today and a significant contributor to the global disease burden. The effects of depression, which can be persistent or recurrent, can have a substantial impact on a person's ability to function and live a fulfilling life (WHO, 2019). Therefore, detecting depression at an early stage is necessary for leading a better life.

This project undertakes a deep learning approach for detecting depression effectively from text, audio and video of individuals at an early stage. The dataset used in this project is a publicly available dataset namely the DAIC-WOZ dataset. This database is included within a larger corpus, the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC) (Gratch et al., 2014), containing clinical interviews intended to support the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This research follows KDD methodology to extract useful knowledge from this dataset. Deep learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM and Bi-LSTM are used here for effective depression detection. Also, multimodal fusion technique is implemented in this research combining all the three modalities which are text, audio and video using LSTM and Bi-LSTM algorithms at sentence level and word level to check whether this fusion technique improve the accuracy of depression detection.
