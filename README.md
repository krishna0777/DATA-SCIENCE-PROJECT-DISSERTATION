Depression is a prevalent mental illness. According to estimates, the illness affects 5% of adults worldwide. Persistent sadness and a lack of interest in formerly fulfilling or enjoyable activities are its defining traits. The most common disability in the world today is depression, which also contributes significantly to the burden of disease on the planet. A person's capacity to function and lead a fulfilling life can be significantly impacted by the symptoms of depression, which can be persistent or recurrent (WHO, 2019). Therefore, early detection of depression is essential for leading a better life. 

This project uses deep learning to effectively identify early-stage depression in people from text, audio, and video. The DAIC-WOZ dataset, which is a publicly accessible dataset, was used in this project. This database is a part of the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC) (Gratch et al., 2014), a larger corpus that contains clinical interviews meant to aid in the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions like anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The KDD methodology is used in this study to glean useful information from the dataset. For accurate depression detection, deep learning algorithms like CNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM are used in this study. Additionally, the multimodal fusion technique is used in this study to combine the three modalities of text, audio, and video using the LSTM and Bi-LSTM algorithms at the sentence and word levels to see if it improves the precision of depression detection. The main conclusions of the study highlight audio-based data's superior performance in detecting depression, consistently achieving the highest metrics. LSTM models perform better than other modalities, especially those without Sentence-Level Gating. However, combining different modalities doesn't always yield better outcomes. The study recommends giving LSTM models priority for efficient depression detection.
